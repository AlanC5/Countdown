This Chrome Extension was merely an experiment to play with the tools listed below:
- Jquery
- Mustache (Client Side Rendering)
- Chrome Extension
- Awesome Fonts


The user experience needs to be improved in several ways. 
- Notify users when countdown mode changes, multiple people have voiced confusion concerning the lack of labels
- Users are unaware that they can change the "icon" for their goal and ambition
